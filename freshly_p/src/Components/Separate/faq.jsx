            The majority of our meals are single serving and meant to feed an
            average adult. We also offer multi-serve proteins and sides, which
            are designed to feed multiple people for extra mealtime flexibility.
            These delicious, ready-to-heat options can help you bulk up existing
            meals, simplify home cooking, or even build an entire meal—the
            choice is yours!

            Our 6-meal plan is perfect for a person looking for 6 dinners (or
            lunches!) a week. On average, our meals weigh in at about 13 ounces
            and range from 300 to 650 calories. If you have a larger household,
            we do offer a 12 meal per week subscription (it’s perfect for
            couples or a family of 4 looking for 3 meals per week). Plus, you
            can always order multiple subscriptions.

            Our meals are chef prepared and delivered fresh, so typically they
            have a refrigerated shelf life of about 3-5 days. Select items (such
            as seafood) are best eaten first, so we’ll add a badge on the
            package to let you know. We usually suggest enjoying these meals
            within the first few days of receiving your order, but you can
            always check their exact use-by date on the back-of-pack nutrition
            label. If you’re ever unable to finish your meals within their shelf
            life, you can always pop them into the freezer for extended storage.
            Just be sure to microwave your meal straight from the freezer and
            add a few extra minutes to reach the 165° F internal temperature we
            recommend.

            Your meals will come to you fully prepared so you just have to heat
            ‘em up in the microwave. On the back of each meal, you’ll find our
            easy steps for heating, but generally, the meals heat up in about 3
            minutes (depending on your microwave). If you’re unsure, start at 2
            minutes and heat in 30–second increments until the meal reaches an
            inner temperature of 165° F. Our meals are packaged to be heated in
            the microwave (for the ultimate convenience), but you can heat them
            in the oven if you’d like. Just so you know, our current meal
            containers aren’t safe for the oven or stovetop, so you’ll have to
            transfer your food to heat it up. You can check out the full oven
            reheat directions in our FAQ.

            offer delivery every day of the week. The exact days that we can
            reach you will depend on your ZIP code and the carrier delivering
            your Freshly meals. Whether you're signing up or updating your
            typical delivery day, we'll show you all the days available to you
            so you can choose what's best for you.
